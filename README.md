This code describe implementation of plugin to ImageJ. This plugin uses finite difference coefficents to calculate n-th order derivative from discrete function. N-th order derivatve is used to sharpen image or stack of images by one of 3 axes (X, Y or Z). To run this plugin JAR file must be created and inserted into ImageJ directory.
